### 4.1. Agentic Architecture (Key for Copilot)

This is the heart of CalendarGPT's intelligence. Understand it well.

#### 4.1.1. ToolRegistry (`src/tools/tool-registry.ts`)

- **Purpose**: Central hub for all available tools.
- **Extensibility**: Designed for easy addition of new tools and categories.
- **Schema Validation**: Uses Zod for strict parameter validation of tools, ensuring type safety and clear contracts.
- **Tool Discovery**: Allows the `ToolOrchestrator` to find and understand available tools.
- **Your Role**: When adding a new tool, you MUST register it here with a clear Zod schema for its parameters and a concise description.

#### 4.1.2. ToolOrchestrator (`src/services/tool-orchestrator.ts`)

- **Purpose**: Manages the agentic, multi-step reasoning process.
- **Workflow**:
  1.  **Analysis**: Analyzes user requests to understand intent.
  2.  **Planning**: Decides which tool(s) to use, in what order, and with what parameters. This may involve multiple iterations.
  3.  **Execution**: Calls tools via the `ToolRegistry`.
  4.  **Evaluation**: Assesses tool outputs and decides if the goal is met or if more steps/tools are needed.
  5.  **Synthesis**: Combines information from tool calls into a comprehensive, user-friendly response.
- **Context Awareness**: Maintains context across multiple tool calls.
- **Error Handling**: Implements basic error handling and can report tool failures.
- **Your Role**: When implementing features requiring complex actions, think about how the `ToolOrchestrator` can break down the task. Your prompts to the orchestrator (via `ai-service.ts`) should be clear about the overall goal.

#### 4.1.3. Supported Tool Categories

- **Current**: `calendar-tools.ts`, `web-tools.ts`
- **Future**: Email, file operations, etc. The system is designed for this expansion.

#### 4.1.4. Agentic Workflow (High-Level)

User Request → AI Analysis (Orchestrator) → Planning (Tool Selection) → Iterative Tool Execution & Evaluation → Synthesized Response.

#### 4.1.5. Development Mode Insights

Development mode provides visibility into the orchestrator's reasoning steps, tool calls, parameters, and responses. Use this for debugging and understanding agent behavior.

## 6. Development Guidelines (Your Rulebook)

Adhere to these guidelines strictly to maintain code quality, consistency, and project health.

### 6.1. General Principles

- **Clarity and Readability**: Write code that is easy to understand. Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
- **Modularity**: Break down complex logic into smaller, reusable functions or components.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Avoid code duplication.
- **SOLID Principles**: Apply them where appropriate, especially in service and tool design.

### 6.2. Code Style & Formatting

- **ESLint & Prettier**: The project uses ESLint (config: `eslint.config.mjs`) which integrates Prettier. **All code MUST conform to these rules.** Ensure your editor is set up to format on save or run `npm run lint -- --fix` and `npm run format` regularly.
- **TypeScript First**:
  - Use TypeScript for all new code.
  - Employ strong typing. Avoid `any` where possible; use `unknown` for safer alternatives if type is truly unknown, or define specific types/interfaces.
  - Use `interfaces` for public APIs and object shapes, `type` for utility types, unions, intersections.
  - Leverage TypeScript's utility types (e.g., `Partial`, `Readonly`, `ReturnType`).
- **React Best Practices**:
  - Prefer functional components with Hooks.
  - Use Server Components where appropriate for performance (default in Next.js App Router).
  - Clearly distinguish Client Components (`'use client';`) when interactivity or browser APIs are needed.
  - Follow rules of Hooks.
- **Comments**:
  - Write JSDoc comments for public functions, classes, and complex type definitions, explaining purpose, parameters, and return values if not obvious.
  - Add inline comments to explain complex or non-obvious logic.
  - **Do not over-comment simple, self-explanatory code.**
- **Naming Conventions**:
  - `camelCase` for variables and functions.
  - `PascalCase` for classes, React components, and type/interface names.
  - `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants.
  - Boolean variables/functions should sound like questions (e.g., `isValid`, `shouldUpdate`).

### 6.3. UI Development (`src/components/`, `src/app/`)

- **DaisyUI & Tailwind CSS**:
  - Leverage DaisyUI components for consistency (`Button`, `Card`, `Modal`, etc.).
  - Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for custom styling and layout.
  - Strive for a clean, intuitive, and responsive UI.
- **Lucide React Icons**: Use for iconography.
- **Accessibility (a11y)**: Keep accessibility in mind. Use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes where necessary.
- **State Management**:
  - For local component state, use `useState` and `useReducer`.
  - For global state or cross-component state, consider React Context or if complexity grows, libraries like Zustand or Jotai (currently not in use, discuss before adding).
  - For server state, caching, and mutations (e.g., API calls), Next.js App Router's model with Server Components and Server Actions is preferred. Client components can use `fetch` or libraries like `SWR`/`TanStack Query` if needed (currently not explicitly used, discuss before adding).

### 6.4. Backend Development (`src/app/api/`, `src/services/`)

- **Next.js API Routes**: Follow Next.js conventions for API route handlers.
- **Service Layer**: Encapsulate business logic in services (`src/services/`). Services should be testable and potentially reusable.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling. Return meaningful error messages and HTTP status codes from API endpoints.
- **Security**:
  - Validate all inputs (especially from users or external APIs). Zod is excellent for this.
  - Sanitize outputs where appropriate.
  - Be mindful of authentication and authorization for sensitive operations.

### 6.5. Tool Development (`src/tools/`) - Crucial for Agentic Features

This is a core area of development. Follow these patterns meticulously.

#### 6.5.1. Adding a New Tool

1.  **Define Parameters with Zod**: In `src/tools/tool-definitions.ts` (or a new category-specific definition file), create a Zod schema for the tool's input parameters.
    - Each parameter MUST have a `.describe()` call explaining its purpose clearly. This description is used by the AI to understand how to use the tool.
    ```typescript
    export const MyNewToolParamsSchema = z.object({
      targetId: z.string().describe("The ID of the target entity."),
      isUrgent: z
        .boolean()
        .optional()
        .describe("Set to true if the operation is urgent."),
    });
    ```
2.  **Implement the Tool Logic**:
    - Create or update a tool category file (e.g., `src/tools/my-category-tools.ts`).
    - Write an `async` function that takes the validated parameters and performs the tool's action.
    - The function MUST return a `ToolResult` object:
      ```typescript
      interface ToolResult<T = unknown> {
        success: boolean;
        data?: T;
        error?: string; // For technical/internal errors
        message?: string; // User-facing message or summary of action
      }
      ```
    - Example:
      ```typescript
      async function myNewToolExecutor(
        params: z.infer<typeof MyNewToolParamsSchema>
      ): Promise<ToolResult<{ outcome: string }>> {
        try {
          // ... tool logic ...
          return {
            success: true,
            data: { outcome: "Achieved" },
            message: "Tool executed successfully.",
          };
        } catch (e) {
          const error = e instanceof Error ? e.message : "Unknown error";
          return {
            success: false,
            error: `MyNewTool failed: ${error}`,
            message: "Failed to execute the new tool.",
          };
        }
      }
      ```
3.  **Register the Tool**: In `src/tools/tool-registry.ts`:
    - Import the schema and executor.
    - Call `registry.registerTool()`:
      ```typescript
      registry.registerTool(
        {
          name: "myNewTool",
          description:
            "A clear, concise description of what this tool does and when to use it.", // Crucial for AI
          parameters: MyNewToolParamsSchema,
          category: "MyCategory", // Or an existing category
        },
        myNewToolExecutor
      );
      ```
4.  **Write Tests**: Add comprehensive unit tests for the new tool in `src/__tests__/` (e.g., `my-category-tools.test.ts`). Mock any external dependencies.

#### 6.5.2. Tool Design Best Practices

- **Single Responsibility**: Tools should ideally do one thing well.
- **Idempotency**: If possible, design tools to be idempotent.
- **Clear Descriptions**: The `name` and `description` fields during registration are CRITICAL for the `ToolOrchestrator` (and you, Copilot!) to understand when and how to use the tool.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Return `success: false` with informative `error` and `message` fields on failure.
- **Performance**: Be mindful of tool execution time, especially for tools calling external APIs. Implement timeouts if necessary.

### 6.6. Testing (`src/__tests__/`, `jest.config.js`)

**Comprehensive testing is mandatory.**

#### 6.6.1. Testing Philosophy

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions, modules, and React components in isolation. Mock dependencies.
- **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between modules or services (e.g., a service interacting with a mocked API client).
- **Component Tests (React)**: Use React Testing Library (`@testing-library/react`).
  - Test component behavior from a user's perspective. Interact with the component as a user would (find elements, simulate events).
  - Avoid testing implementation details.
- **API Route Tests**: Test API endpoints by mocking service layer dependencies.
- **Functional Tests**: Test specific user flows or features end-to-end (within the scope of backend/service logic, not full E2E browser tests yet).

#### 6.6.2. How to Write Tests

- **File Location**: Tests reside in `src/__tests__/`. Mirror the directory structure of `src/` where applicable (e.g., `src/__tests__/components/Chat.test.tsx` for `src/components/Chat.tsx`).
- **Naming**: Use `*.test.ts` or `*.test.tsx` extensions.
- **Jest & Testing Library**: Familiarize yourself with their APIs.
- **Mocking**:
  - Use `jest.mock('./path/to/module')` for mocking modules.
  - Use `jest.fn()` for mock functions.
  - Mock service dependencies for component and API tests.
  - Mock API clients (like Google Calendar or OpenAI) for service tests.
- **Assertions**: Use Jest's `expect` matchers.
- **Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage. Run `npm run test:coverage` to check. While 100% isn't always practical, critical paths and complex logic MUST be covered.

#### 6.6.3. Running Tests

- `npm test`: Run all tests.
- `npm run test:watch`: Run tests in watch mode.
- `npm run test:coverage`: Run tests and generate a coverage report.
- `npm test -- --testPathPattern=Chat.test.tsx`: Run specific test files.

#### 6.6.4. Your Role in Testing (Copilot)

- **When adding new features or fixing bugs, YOU MUST write or update corresponding tests.**
- If you generate a new function, component, or service, ask yourself: "How can this be tested?" and then generate the test.
- Ensure tests cover:
  - Happy paths.
  - Edge cases.
  - Error conditions.

### 6.7. Documentation

- **READMEs**: Keep `README.md` and other documentation (e.g., in `docs/` if created) up-to-date.
- **JSDoc**: As mentioned in Code Style, use for public APIs and complex types.
- **This Document**: If you identify gaps or outdated information here, please suggest updates!

### 6.8. Version Control (Git)

- Follow conventional commit messages (e.g., `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`, `docs: ...`, `test: ...`).
- Create feature branches for new development.
- Rebase or merge branches regularly.

## 7. Copilot's Role & Agentic Mode Best Practices

This section is specifically for you, GitHub Copilot, especially when operating in "agent mode" or fulfilling complex requests.

### 7.1. Your Primary Objective

To assist in developing CalendarGPT by generating high-quality, consistent, and well-tested code, adhering to all guidelines in this document.

### 7.2. Understanding Requests

- **Clarify Ambiguity**: If a user's request is unclear, ask for clarification before proceeding.
- **Break Down Complex Tasks**: For large features, think about the smaller, manageable pieces. You can suggest a plan.

### 7.3. Leveraging the Agentic Architecture

- **Think Like an Agent**: When a task involves multiple steps or information gathering (e.g., "Find all meetings next week about project X and then summarize them"), consider how the `ToolOrchestrator` would handle this.
- **Prioritize Existing Tools**: Before suggesting or creating a new tool, ALWAYS check if existing tools (see `src/tools/` and their registrations in `tool-registry.ts`) can achieve the goal or part of it. The `ToolOrchestrator` is designed to combine tools.
- **Tool Design**: If a new tool is genuinely needed:
  - Follow the "Tool Development" guidelines (Section 6.5) strictly.
  - Ensure its `description` and parameter `describe()` calls are crystal clear for the AI orchestrator.
- **Iterative Problem Solving**: The agentic system works iteratively. Your contributions should support this. For example, if a tool provides partial information, the next step might be another tool call based on those results.

### 7.4. Code Generation

- **Adhere to Guidelines**: All generated code (UI, backend, tools, tests, types) MUST follow the project's code style, TypeScript usage, and testing strategy outlined in Section 6.
- **Context is Key**: Use the provided file context and this document to generate relevant and consistent code.
- **Security and Performance**: Keep these in mind, especially for backend and tool development.

### 7.5. Testing is Non-Negotiable

- **Generate Tests**: For any new logic, component, or tool you create, you are expected to also generate the corresponding tests.
- **Verify Tests**: If you modify existing code, ensure existing tests still pass, or update them as needed.

### 7.6. Learning and Adapting

- This document is your "source of truth" for project conventions.
- If you encounter patterns or practices in the codebase not covered here, try to follow the existing style.
- Your ability to learn from the existing codebase and this guide is crucial for success.

## 8. How to Approach Common Tasks

### 8.1. Adding a New Feature (e.g., a new UI component with backend logic)

1.  **Understand Requirements**: What should the feature do?
2.  **Plan**:
    - UI: What components are needed? What state?
    - Backend: New API endpoint? Service logic? New tools?
    - Types: Define necessary TypeScript types/interfaces in `src/types/`.
3.  **Implement**:
    - Create components in `src/components/`.
    - Add API routes in `src/app/api/`.
    - Implement services in `src/services/`.
    - If agentic, develop tools in `src/tools/` (following Section 6.5).
4.  **Test**: Write unit, integration, and component tests (following Section 6.6).
5.  **Document**: Update READMEs or JSDoc if necessary.

### 8.2. Fixing a Bug

1.  **Reproduce**: Understand how to trigger the bug.
2.  **Identify Cause**: Debug to find the root cause.
3.  **Implement Fix**: Correct the code.
4.  **Test**:
    - Write a new test that specifically covers the bug (to prevent regressions).
    - Ensure all existing tests still pass.

### 8.3. Refactoring Code

1.  **Understand Purpose**: Why is the refactor needed (e.g., improve readability, performance, maintainability)?
2.  **Ensure Test Coverage**: Before refactoring, make sure the code is well-tested.
3.  **Refactor Incrementally**: Make small, verifiable changes.
4.  **Re-run Tests**: Ensure all tests pass after each increment.
