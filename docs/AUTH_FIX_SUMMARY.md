# Google OAuth Fix Summary

## Problem
After Google sign-in, users were redirected to a "Server Error" page but were actually logged in successfully.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by:
1. **Redirect URL mismatch** between the configured NEXTAUTH_URL (ngrok) and actual development environment (localhost)
2. **Missing error handling** in the session callback
3. **Cookie configuration issues** for development environment

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Custom Error Page
- Created `/src/app/auth/error/page.tsx` for better error handling
- Provides clear error messages and navigation back to home

### 2. Fixed NextAuth.js Configuration
- **Enhanced redirect handling** to work with both local and ngrok URLs
- **Improved error handling** in session and JWT callbacks
- **Fixed cookie configuration** for development environment
- **Added debugging** (without exposing secrets)

### 3. Environment Configuration
- Created `.env.local` for local development with localhost URLs
- Original `.env` kept for production/ngrok usage

## How to Test the Fix

### Option 1: Local Development (Recommended)
1. **Use the local environment**:
   ```bash
   # The .env.local file will be used automatically
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Access the app**:
   - Open `http://localhost:3000`
   - Click "Sign in with Google"
   - Should redirect correctly to home page after authentication

3. **Update Google Console** (if needed):
   - Add `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google` to authorized redirect URIs

### Option 2: Ngrok Development
1. **Keep original .env**:
   ```bash
   # Use original .env with ngrok URLs
   mv .env.local .env.local.backup
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Ensure ngrok is running**:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```

3. **Update Google Console**:
   - Ensure `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app/api/auth/callback/google` is in authorized redirect URIs

## Verification Steps

1. **Check server logs** for debug messages:
   - `üîê SignIn callback:`
   - `üîÑ Redirect callback:`
   - `‚úÖ Session created successfully:`

2. **Test the flow**:
   - Navigate to the app
   - Click "Sign in with Google"
   - Complete Google authentication
   - Should redirect to home page instead of server error

3. **Verify login**:
   - Check if user is logged in by visiting protected pages
   - Check browser cookies for session tokens

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:
1. **Check Google Console** redirect URI configuration
2. **Clear browser cookies** and cache
3. **Restart the development server**
4. **Check browser console** for JavaScript errors
5. **Verify database connection** with `npx tsx test-db-connection.ts`
