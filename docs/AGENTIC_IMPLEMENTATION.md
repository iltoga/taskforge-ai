# CalendarGPT Agentic Tool Orchestration - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Implementation

We have successfully refactored CalendarGPT to implement a true agentic, multi-step tool-calling workflow. Here's what was built:

### üß† Core Architecture Components

#### 1. **ToolRegistry** (`/src/tools/tool-registry.ts`)

- Extensible system for registering and managing tools
- Type-safe tool parameter validation using Zod schemas
- Support for calendar tools with potential for future expansion (email, file, web tools)
- Automatic tool execution with error handling

#### 2. **ToolOrchestrator** (`/src/services/tool-orchestrator.ts`)

- Intelligent AI agent that can:
  - Analyze user requests and plan tool usage
  - Call tools iteratively based on intermediate results
  - Evaluate when sufficient information is gathered
  - Synthesize comprehensive final answers

- Tracks all reasoning steps and tool executions
- Configurable with development mode for full transparency

#### 3. **Enhanced AI Service** (`/src/services/ai-service.ts`)

- Updated to use centralized ModelType from config
- Support for new agentic orchestration mode
- Backward compatibility with legacy and simple tool modes

- Proper temperature handling for reasoning models (o3, o3-mini)

#### 4. **Dual Model Selection UI**

- **Chat Model Selector**: For general conversation and legacy mode
- **Orchestrator Model Selector**: Specifically for the agentic AI that plans and orchestrates tool calls
- Toggle between modes: Legacy ‚Üí Tools ‚Üí Agentic

### üéõÔ∏è Three Operation Modes

1. **Legacy Mode** (Original JSON-based calendar actions)
2. **Tools Mode** (Simple tool-based responses)
3. **Agentic Mode** (NEW: Multi-step reasoning and tool orchestration)

### üîß Tool Categories Implemented

#### Calendar Tools

- `getEvents` - List calendar events with filters
- `searchEvents` - Search events by keywords/company names
- `createEvent` - Create new calendar events
- `updateEvent` - Modify existing events

- `deleteEvent` - Remove events

### üöÄ How to Test the New Agentic System

#### Prerequisites

1. Ensure all environment variables are set (OpenAI API key, Google OAuth, etc.)
2. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

#### Testing Steps

1. **Navigate to the Chat Interface**
   - Enable "Tool Mode" toggle
   - Enable "Agentic Mode" toggle
   - Select your preferred "Orchestrator AI" model (e.g., GPT-4o, o3-mini for reasoning)

2. **Test Agentic Queries**

   ```
   "Show me my Nespola events from March to June 2025"
   "Find all meetings related to project management this month"

   "What conflicts do I have next week and suggest solutions"
   ```

3. **Development Mode Features**
   - See all AI reasoning steps
   - View tool call parameters and results
   - Track decision-making process

   - Monitor tool execution timing

#### Expected Behavior

**User Input**: "Show me all Nespola events from March to June 2025"

**Agentic Process**:

1. **Analysis**: AI analyzes request (company name search + time range)
2. **Planning**: Decides to use `searchEvents` tool with "Nespola" query
3. **Execution**: Calls tool with proper time range parameters
4. **Evaluation**: Checks if results are sufficient
5. **Synthesis**: Formats results into user-friendly response

**UI Display**:

- Shows reasoning steps (in dev mode)
- Displays tool calls and results
- Badge indicates "Agentic Mode"
- Final formatted answer

### üîÑ Extensibility for Future Tools

The architecture is designed to easily add new tool categories:

```typescript
// Future Email Tools
registry.registerTool({
  name: 'sendEmail',
  description: 'Send an email to recipients',
  parameters: EmailSchema,
  category: 'email'
}, emailExecutor);

// Future File Tools
registry.registerTool({
  name: 'searchFiles',
  description: 'Search files in cloud storage',
  parameters: FileSearchSchema,
  category: 'file'
}, fileExecutor);
```

### üìä Development Mode Features

- **Step-by-Step Reasoning**: See how the AI analyzes and plans
- **Tool Call Transparency**: View exact parameters and responses
- **Execution Timing**: Monitor performance of each step
- **Error Tracking**: Detailed error information for debugging

### üéØ Key Benefits Achieved

1. **True Agency**: AI makes autonomous decisions about which tools to use and when
2. **Multi-Step Reasoning**: Can chain multiple tool calls based on intermediate results
3. **Extensible Architecture**: Easy to add new tool categories (email, file, web, etc.)
4. **Development Transparency**: Full visibility into AI reasoning process
5. **Dual Model Selection**: Separate models for chat vs orchestration
6. **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy and simple tool modes still work

### üêõ Testing Checklist

- [ ] Legacy mode still works (JSON responses)
- [ ] Simple tool mode works (single tool calls)
- [ ] Agentic mode shows reasoning steps
- [ ] Tool calls execute successfully
- [ ] Error handling works properly
- [ ] Model switching works
- [ ] UI shows proper badges and indicators
- [ ] Development mode shows all details

The system is now ready for testing and can be extended with additional tool categories as needed!
