### Key Improvements:
1. **More Specific**: "Executing calendar tools" instead of generic "tools"
2. **Results-Driven**: Status shows actual findings (event count, errors)
3. **Context-Aware**: Different messages for different scenarios
4. **Performance Info**: Shows actual execution times and step counts
5. **Error Details**: Specific error types and retry information
6. **Progress Tracking**: Tool usage limits and iteration counts
