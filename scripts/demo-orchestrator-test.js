📋 Test Overview:
This functional test demonstrates the complete orchestrator capabilities by:

1. 🧠 Multi-Step Reasoning
   - Analysis: Parse complex natural language task
   - Planning: Generate optimal execution plan
   - Execution: Use both MCP servers and internal tools
   - Evaluation: Assess progress and adapt if needed
   - Synthesis: Create comprehensive final response

2. 🔌 Cross-Domain Tool Integration
   - MCP Filesystem Server: List files, read README
   - Internal Calendar Tools: Search for meetings
   - Synthesis Tools: Generate comprehensive reports

3. 🎯 Task Optimization
   - Minimal number of steps for maximum efficiency
   - Intelligent tool selection based on context
   - Error recovery and graceful degradation

📝 Example Task:
"I need you to help me prepare for a project review meeting. Here's what I need:
1. Check if there are any files in my current project directory
2. If there's a README file, read its contents to understand the project  
3. Look for any calendar events related to 'project review' in the next 2 weeks
4. Create a summary report with project overview and scheduled meetings"

🔧 Expected Orchestration Steps:
1. Analysis: Parse multi-part request and identify required tools
2. Tool Call: list_directory (MCP filesystem server)
3. Tool Call: read_file README.md (MCP filesystem server)  
4. Tool Call: searchEvents "project review" (Internal calendar tools)
5. Synthesis: Generate comprehensive project review preparation report

✅ Success Criteria:
- Uses both MCP servers and internal tools
- Executes efficiently (≤8 tool calls)
- Generates comprehensive, accurate response
- Handles errors gracefully
- Completes in reasonable time (<10 seconds)

🚀 To run the actual test:
1. Set up environment variables (OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.)
2. Run: npm run test:orchestrator-ui
3. Watch the orchestrator demonstrate sophisticated multi-step reasoning!

This test proves that TaskForge AI can handle real-world, complex tasks using
sophisticated agentic orchestration with both internal and external tools.
